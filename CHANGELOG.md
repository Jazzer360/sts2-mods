# Changelog

All notable changes to the mods in this repo. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Each mod is versioned separately; entries are grouped under the mod they affect.

Every pull request or commit that changes behavior adds a line under **Unreleased**. When a mod is released, its Unreleased entries move under a version heading with the date and the game version it was tested on.

## [Unreleased]

### Spire QoL 0.2.0 (first in-game test build, game v0.111.0)
#### Added
- **Layout system:** F8 unlocks the layout. Then drag widgets to move them, scroll to scale them, right-click to reset; they snap to the nearest of nine screen anchors. F9 hides/shows all overlays. Positions are saved to `SpireQoL.settings.cfg`.
- **Settings file** `mods/SpireQoL/SpireQoL.settings.cfg`: feature toggles, per-relic toggles, hotkeys, Ethereal opacity, flash speed.
- **Relic Counters:** a tray of tick-mark bars for counter relics (Pen Nib, Nunchaku, Tuning Fork, Iron Club, Kunai, Shuriken, Stone Calendar and more), turn-trigger relics and one-shot relics. A row flashes when the relic is about to fire. Counters that carry across turns sort first.
- **Relic Reminders:** relic icons on cards in hand. Crossed out for Art of War / Ripple Basin on attacks. Plain for Vambrace, Throwing Axe, Burning Sticks, Unsettling Lamp, Permafrost and Music Box while unused. Pulsing violet border on attacks when Pen Nib is ready.
- **Block Forecast:** end-of-turn block from Plating, Frost orbs, Orichalcum, Cloak Clasp, Ripple Basin; Horn Cleat / Captain's Wheel shown the turn before.
- **Incoming Damage:** total blockable damage (enemy intents + Burn, Decay, Infection, Toxic, Wither, Constrict, Magic Bomb, Disintegration) vs. your block plus forecast block; unblockable HP loss (Regret, Bad Luck, Beckon, Demise) listed separately.
- **Card Indicators:** Ethereal cards are translucent; badges for ETH, RET / RET·1, SLY / SLY·1, +EXH (and optional INN / ETR); cards blocked by Bound, Ringing, Smog or Velvet Choker are dimmed with the reason; Galvanized cards show their self-damage.
- **Shuffle Warning:** draws left before a reshuffle; SHUFFLE badge on draw cards that would trigger it; KEPT badge on the other hand cards while a mid-turn shuffle is possible; draw potions that would shuffle are listed.

#### Changed
- Split the planned "Combat Math" into **Block Forecast** and **Incoming Damage**. "Keyword Badges" grew into **Card Indicators**.

#### Known gaps
- No in-game settings menu yet (edit the `.cfg` file). Intent Forecast not built. No health-bar damage preview. See "Not yet" under each feature in `docs/FEATURES.md`.

### Repo
#### Added
- Shared `core/`: settings file, overlay host (frame loop, hotkeys, per-feature error isolation), movable widgets, tick bar, game-state helpers.
- Monorepo build setup that references the game's assemblies from your install and copies built mods into `<game>/mods/`.
- Docs: feature reference (`docs/FEATURES.md`), work tracker (`docs/TRACKER.md`), roadmap, and notes on how the mod loader works.
