# Changelog

All notable changes to the mods in this repo. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Each mod is versioned separately; entries are grouped under the mod they affect.

Every pull request or commit that changes behavior adds a line under **Unreleased**. When a mod is released, its Unreleased entries move under a version heading with the date and the game version it was tested on.

## [Unreleased]

### Spire QoL 0.11.0
#### Changed
- **Keyword tabs** (Retain, Sly, double play) moved from the card's left edge to a centered row along its **top edge**, overlapping slightly, so they're visible in a fanned hand without hovering. Text badges and relic icons now sit just above the tabs.

### Spire QoL 0.10.0
#### Changed
- **Double play** now shows as a native-style tab with the Echo Form power icon, with the play count in the tab's number slot. It replaces the `×N` badge and the echo ripples.

#### Removed
- Echo ripples (0.8.0). They didn't render in game; the card's glow node likely has no plain texture to copy.

#### Verified
- 0.8.0 session log: no errors.
- The HP bar node reports a 0×0 box at the bar's center, which confirms why the tray drew over the bar before 0.7.0. The measured container is 250px wide.

### Spire QoL 0.9.0
#### Changed
- **Retain and Sly** now show as native-style tabs on the card's left edge, replacing the `RET` / `SLY` text badges. Each tab is a copy of the card's own enchantment tab.
  - Retain uses the Steady enchantment icon; Sly uses the Master Planner power icon.
  - A `1` in the tab means this turn only.

### Spire QoL 0.8.0
#### Added
- **Double-play indicator:** cards that will play more than once get echo ripples, copies of the card's own glow outline expanding outward and fading, inspired by Echo Form's afterimages, plus a `×2` / `×3` badge.
  - The count comes from the game's own play-count calculation, so Echo Form, Burst, Duplication, One-Two Punch, Signal Boost, Throwing Axe, Tag Team (best case across enemies) and enchantment replays are all covered.
  - Setting: `ShowDoublePlay`.

### Spire QoL 0.7.0 (feedback from fifth test)
#### Added
- **Pin picker and Attach button** on every widget while the layout is unlocked (F8):
  - A 3×3 grid chooses which corner or edge of the widget stays fixed when it grows or shrinks.
  - The button switches between following your character and staying fixed on screen.
  - Ctrl+1–9 and middle-click remain as shortcuts.

#### Changed
- Dragging a widget keeps the pin you chose. It no longer silently re-anchors to the nearest screen point, which is why picking an anchor didn't seem to work.
- Relic Counters measures the HP bar's visible container (`%HpBarContainer`). The bar node's own box stopped short, so the tray drew over the bar. It also gets 12px of padding. The measured rects are logged once per combat, for checking.

#### Fixed
- Pale Blue Dot's label said "attacks"; it counts every card played (the game's property is misleadingly named `AttacksPlayedThisTurn`).

### Spire QoL 0.6.0 (feedback from fourth test)
#### Changed
- **Floating widgets draw behind your cards in hand.** During combat they're placed inside the game's combat UI, just before the hand. They move back on top while the layout is unlocked, so you can drag them.
- **Relic Counters tray** now attaches just right of your HP bar, with its bottom edge level with the bar's bottom, so it stays clear of enemies. Your saved position for it is reset once.
- **Ethereal translucency** is skipped for cards that are only Ethereal because of Hex (the act 3 elite's Hexed affliction). Default opacity raised from 70% to 80%; a saved 0.7 is raised to 0.8 once.

#### Added
- **Ctrl+1–9** over a widget while the layout is unlocked pins it to a chosen screen anchor (numpad layout), keeping its position.

#### Verified in game
- Pael's Tears tray row and card warnings. Floating widgets hide correctly under the pause menu and deck/pile screens. No errors in the 0.5.0 session log.

### Spire QoL 0.5.0 (feedback from third test)
#### Added
- **Countdown powers in the counter tray:** Orbit, Automation, Cacophony (across turns); Panache, Pale Blue Dot (per turn); and the enemy power Withering Presence (every 6 of your cards adds a Wither), in red.
- **Pael's Tears:**
  - The counter tray shows whether you still have energy to carry into next turn.
  - Cards that would spend your last energy (including X-cost cards) get a crossed-out Pael's Tears icon.

#### Changed
- Counters longer than 12 steps (Cacophony's 33) show only the countdown number, no bar.
- Incoming Damage's attack icon now matches the incoming total's tier, using the same thresholds as enemy intents.

#### Fixed
- Incoming Damage's attack icon showed the game's missing-texture placeholder. The plain `intent_attack.tres` isn't shipped; the game uses tiered `attack/intent_attack_N` icons.
- The counter tray and other floating widgets drew over the pause menu, pile views, deck view, rewards and the map. They now hide while any of those are open.

### Spire QoL 0.4.0 (feedback from second test)
#### Changed
- **Incoming Damage** is now a stacked sum with the game's attack/defend icons: incoming, minus end-of-turn block, equals damage taken.
- **Incoming Damage placement:** now just left of the block indicator on your HP bar. If that doesn't fit on screen, it goes below the HP bar and every row of power icons (measured from the icons, so wrapped rows count). It no longer covers your powers. Your saved position for it is reset once.
- **Incoming Damage accuracy:** the enemy turn is now simulated hit by hit.
  - Enemies that Poison will kill before they act are left out.
  - Retaliation (Thorns, Flame Barrier, Reflect) that kills an attacker mid multi-hit cancels its remaining hits.
  - Exoskeleton's Hard To Kill (per-hit cap) and Skulking Colony's Hardened Shell (per-turn total cap) are both handled.
  - Doom does not stop attacks; doomed enemies still attack before dying.
- **Block Forecast** no longer lists Horn Cleat / Captain's Wheel. Their block arrives at the start of your turn, after the enemy attacks.

#### Added
- Widgets can try several attach points in order, falling back when one doesn't fit on screen.

### Spire QoL 0.3.0 (feedback from first test)
#### Changed
- **Incoming Damage** is now one line, `Incoming N · Block N · Take N`, centered under the player's HP and power icons. It follows your character. "Take" includes unblockable HP loss. Your saved position for it is reset once to the new default.
- **Block Forecast** hides while Incoming Damage is showing, since that line already includes end-of-turn block.
- **Relic Counters:** one-shot relics no longer get a tray row; their icon on the card that uses them is enough. Pael's Eye keeps its row (it has no card to mark).
- **Card Indicators:** removed the `ETH` badge; translucency alone marks Ethereal cards.

#### Removed
- **Shuffle Warning** summary box. The `SHUFFLE` / `KEPT` card badges remain.

#### Added
- Widgets can attach to a game element. Middle-click (while the layout is unlocked) toggles attached vs. pinned to the screen.

#### Verified in game
- Permafrost reminder on powers; Infection damage (Phrog Parasite) counted in Incoming Damage. Mod loads cleanly, with no errors in the log.

### Spire QoL 0.2.0 (first in-game test build, game v0.111.0)
#### Added
- **Layout system:** F8 unlocks the layout. Then drag widgets to move them, scroll to scale them, right-click to reset; they snap to the nearest of nine screen anchors. F9 hides/shows all overlays. Positions are saved to `SpireQoL.settings.cfg`.
- **Settings file** `mods/SpireQoL/SpireQoL.settings.cfg`: feature toggles, per-relic toggles, hotkeys, Ethereal opacity, flash speed.
- **Relic Counters:** a tray of tick-mark bars for counter relics (Pen Nib, Nunchaku, Tuning Fork, Iron Club, Kunai, Shuriken, Stone Calendar and more), turn-trigger relics and one-shot relics. A row flashes when the relic is about to fire. Counters that carry across turns sort first.
- **Relic Reminders:** relic icons on cards in hand. Crossed out for Art of War / Ripple Basin on attacks. Plain for Vambrace, Throwing Axe, Burning Sticks, Unsettling Lamp, Permafrost and Music Box while unused. Pulsing violet border on attacks when Pen Nib is ready.
- **Block Forecast:** end-of-turn block from Plating, Frost orbs, Orichalcum, Cloak Clasp, Ripple Basin; Horn Cleat / Captain's Wheel shown the turn before.
- **Incoming Damage:** total blockable damage (enemy intents + Burn, Decay, Infection, Toxic, Wither, Constrict, Magic Bomb, Disintegration) vs. your block plus forecast block; unblockable HP loss (Regret, Bad Luck, Beckon, Demise) listed separately.
- **Card Indicators:** Ethereal cards are translucent; badges for ETH, RET / RET·1, SLY / SLY·1, +EXH (and optional INN / ETR); cards blocked by Bound, Ringing, Smog or Velvet Choker are dimmed with the reason; Galvanized cards show their self-damage.
- **Shuffle Warning:** draws left before a reshuffle; SHUFFLE badge on draw cards that would trigger it; KEPT badge on the other hand cards while a mid-turn shuffle is possible; draw potions that would shuffle are listed.

#### Changed
- Split the planned "Combat Math" into **Block Forecast** and **Incoming Damage**. "Keyword Badges" grew into **Card Indicators**.

#### Known gaps
- No in-game settings menu yet (edit the `.cfg` file). Intent Forecast not built. No health-bar damage preview. See "Not yet" under each feature in `docs/FEATURES.md`.

### Repo
#### Added
- Shared `core/`: settings file, overlay host (frame loop, hotkeys, per-feature error isolation), movable widgets, tick bar, game-state helpers.
- Monorepo build setup that references the game's assemblies from your install and copies built mods into `<game>/mods/`.
- Docs: feature reference (`docs/FEATURES.md`), work tracker (`docs/TRACKER.md`), roadmap, and notes on how the mod loader works.
